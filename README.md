# ClearSky PHP Framework
The Simply PHP Framework  

# About
The ClearSky framework was developed to support PHP development by reducing development time and providing intuitive code writing that is easy for beginners.  
You can minimize the functionality of the framework itself and increase what you can do by introducing extension plugins.  
This design concept makes it possible to meet various needs from small-scale API development to large-scale application development with a simple configuration.  

# Start
## create project
```
$ composer create-project mary/clearsky <app_dir> --prefer-dist
```  
If you add "--prefer-dist", the execution speed will be slightly faster.  

## Access
http://localhost/<YOUR-PROJECT-DIR>  
If "Hello!" Is displayed, it is executed correctly.
